[00:09.84] I feel it rising within me
[00:12.00] I can feel it taking ahold
[00:14.22] Some kind of fire in the fury
[00:16.46] Lights my soul
[00:18.17] (Yo)
[00:18.82] It's a new awakening, I've only just begun
[00:20.95] Everything you thought was dead, gonna be reborn
[00:23.18] Can you feel the heat, here I come, you were warned
[00:25.41] Built like a weapon
[00:26.68] Time to reckon with the force
[00:27.66] I-
[00:29.42] Think it's time you see the truth
[00:32.01] Igniting the fury
[00:33.19] The powers that be
[00:34.36] Time to see a different side of me
[00:36.05] It's about to blow
[00:37.40] Feel the madness taking hold
[00:39.57] We're standing on the frontlines waiting for you now
[00:44.20] No we're never backing down
[00:46.42] Feel vengeance shake the ground
[00:48.67] Keep fighting till the end, I'm coming for you
[00:52.55] One shot to burn it all down
[01:01.52] One shot to burn it all down
[01:03.81] One shot, burn it down
[01:05.95] Only got one shot, one shot
[01:08.25] One shot, burn it down
[01:10.44] Yeah, burn it all down
[01:12.80] Some say it feels like a nightmare
[01:14.91] Some say it looks like a vision
[01:17.29] I keep my eyes on the target
[01:19.22] No turning back and you better believe
[01:21.55] Look me in the eyes, did ya get what ya came for?
[01:24.00] Fierce power in the blood runs rampant
[01:26.01] Try to rund and hide, are ya looking for a hero?
[01:28.50] We're all fighting with the secrets that we keep.
[01:30.43] I-
[01:32.10] Think it's time you see the truth
[01:34.74] Igniting the fury
[01:35.91] The powers that be
[01:37.11] Time to see a different side of me
[01:38.51] It's about to blow
[01:40.19] Feel the madness taking hold
[01:42.47] We're standing on the frontlines waiting for you now
[01:46.96] No we're never backing down
[01:49.25] Feel vengeance shake the ground
[01:51.45] Keep fighting to the end, I'm coming for you
[01:55.29] One shot to burn it all down
[02:02.73] In between
[02:04.18] Heaven and hell in the dead of the night
[02:11.39] Breathing in
[02:12.87] A revolution, know that I will rise
[02:20.10] Come with me, run with the shadows
[02:22.36] Come with me, dance in the flames
[02:24.55] We're coming out of the ashes
[02:26.79] Wanna play a dangerous game?
[02:29.04] Come with me, run with the shadows
[02:31.25] Come with me, dance in the flames
[02:33.44] We're coming out of the ashes, you wanna play?
[02:36.81] It's about to blow
[02:38.54] Feel the madness taking hold
[02:40.76] We're standing on the frontlines waiting for you now
[02:45.32] No we're never backing down
[02:47.59] Feel vengeance shake the ground
[02:49.87] Keep fighting till the end, I'm coming for you
[02:53.67] One shot to burn it all down
[03:02.76] One shot to burn it all down
[03:04.94] One shot, burn it down
[03:07.18] Only got one shot, one shot
[03:09.32] One shot, burn it down
[03:13.12] Yeah burn it all down
